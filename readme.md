# What is it
Webpack plugin to track time spent working on a project and individual files.


### Todo
 - **Reporting**
 - Username strategy can be a promise = implement smart username strategy runner
 - Username strategy can be automatically detected
   - make sure that username won't change during development though
   - implement mergeusernames in config to report multiple users as a single user
